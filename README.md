# Alienic-Ride

## Introduction
This is a basic web-based controlling game developed using **Vanilla JS** where the user can control the *Alien* in a spaceship so as to avoid collisions.

## Description:
- The user controls the alien by clicking to make it fly (You can use Space key or Arrow Up Key to control).
- The alien automatically descends due to gravity and needs to be navigated in between the gaps to continue the game.
- Colliding with the Space items or the ground ends the game, and the player's score is recorded.
- Highscore is recorded based on the highest score achieved, providing an incentive for players to aim for new records.
